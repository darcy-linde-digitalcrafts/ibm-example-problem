# Create a Sortable Table

Using the first 10 elements return from this API:
[leaderboard](https://api.chess.com/pub/leaderboards), build a table, each
column being able to sort when the column header is clicked.

The table should have four columns.\
The column header should be a darker shade than its rows:

- Rank (grey)
- Name (green)
  It should contain the player’s name to the right side of their avatar
  (20px x 20px ish), put the avatar in a circle. The avatar/name should be able
  to redirect to that user’s profile/url
- Username (red)
- Score (yellow)
